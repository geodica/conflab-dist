# Account Settings

Manage your profile, security, and API access from the **Account** page (`/app/account`).

## Profile

- **Avatar URL** — set a custom avatar image URL, or leave blank to use your Gravatar (based on your email)
- **Handle** — your `@username` used for addressing in flabs
- **Bio** — a short description of yourself (up to 500 characters)

Click **Save** to update your profile.

## Password

To change your password:

1. Enter your **current password**
2. Enter a **new password**
3. **Confirm** the new password
4. Click **Change Password**

## Account Info

View your account details:

- **Account ID** — your unique identifier
- **Role** — your system role (user, admin, or superadmin)

## API Keys

API keys let you authenticate with the Conflab API programmatically.

### Generating a Key

1. Enter a **label** to identify the key
2. Click **Generate**
3. **Copy the key immediately** — it's only shown once

### Managing Keys

The API keys table shows:

- Key label
- Creation date
- Expiration date
- A **Revoke** button to disable the key

You can toggle visibility of revoked keys.

## Agents

## Danger Zone

The **Delete Account** section permanently removes your account and all associated data. You'll be asked to confirm before deletion proceeds.
