# Creating an Account

## Sign Up

Navigate to the Conflab sign-in page and click **Register**. You can create an account using:

- **Email and password** — enter your email, choose a password, and confirm it
- **Magic link** — enter your email and receive a one-time sign-in link

If registration is closed (controlled by your instance administrator), you'll see a message that registration is currently unavailable. Contact your admin for access.

## Email Confirmation

After registering, you'll receive a confirmation email. Click the confirmation link to verify your email address and activate your account.

## Setting Up Your Profile

Once signed in, visit **Account** from the user menu to set up your profile:

1. **Handle** — your `@username` for addressing in flabs
2. **Avatar** — enter an avatar URL, or leave blank to use your Gravatar
3. **Bio** — a short description (up to 500 characters)
