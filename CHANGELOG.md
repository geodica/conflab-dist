# Changelog

All notable changes to conflab (CLI + daemon) are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **conflabd `--version`** now includes git commit hash, matching CLI format.
- **Conflab.app About window** shows correct release version instead of `0.1.0`.
- **Release script** now bumps macOS app `Info.plist` version alongside Cargo.toml files.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Envoy workflow engine** — multi-step workflow execution in conflabd with step sequencing, error handling policies (`abort`/`continue`/`retry`), and status persistence in SQLite.
- **Policy inspection CLI** — `conflab plugin inspect`, `conflab plugin list`, and `conflab plugin validate` commands for viewing policy engine state and plugin manifests.
- **AppleScript bridge** — conflabd exposes scriptable actions for macOS automation and Automator workflows.
- **Prompt test framework** — validation fixtures, Lua execution fixtures, and a shell smoke-test runner (`scripts/smoke.sh`) for template quality assurance.
- **Build info embedding** — all built artifacts (CLI, daemon, macOS app, web footer) now display their exact git commit hash alongside the version number.

### Security

- **Lua sandbox hardening** — tighter stdlib restrictions, explicit capability gating, SAFETY documentation on all unsafe blocks.
- **MCP bridge security** — stricter policy enforcement on tool access.
- **Plugin manifest validation** — fail-open risk classification fixed to default-deny.
- **Daemon robustness** — mutex poisoning in Lua bridge now propagates errors instead of crashing; clock anomaly handling prevents daemon panics; unknown status values logged as warnings.

### Fixed

- CLI no longer panics on missing home directory — all path-resolution functions return errors gracefully.
- CLI validates required API response fields instead of silently defaulting to empty strings.
- UTF-8 safe key truncation — no longer panics on multi-byte characters.
- Swift macOS app: 5 force unwraps eliminated, 12 silent `try?` sites now log errors.

### Changed

- **Total Codebase Audit** — 49 violations identified and remediated across Elixir (638 tests), Rust (575 tests), and Swift. Zero regressions.
- Display name logic unified into single `Conflab.DisplayName` module (Highlander Rule).
- Command execution extracted from FlabLive into `CommandExecutor` with effect-tuple pattern.
- Avatar URL normalization via atomic Ash change (`NULLIF(TRIM(...))`).
- Slug generation deduplicated into single `Conflab.Slug` module.
- CLI utility functions consolidated into shared `util.rs` module.
- chat.rs WebSocket handler refactored with shared `run_api_call` helper.
- Swift template interpolation consolidated into `TemplateService.substituteVariable`.
- About window extracted into `AboutWindowController`.
- 19 multi-head function refactors across Elixir codebase.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Conflab.app** — native macOS menubar application for daemon lifecycle control, template browsing, MCP plugin management, and settings. Pure AppKit, Swift 6.0 strict concurrency.
- **`conflab app start/stop/status`** — CLI commands for managing Conflab.app.
- **`conflab doctor`** — now checks Conflab.app installation and status.
- **Prompt template engine** — `.cp.md` format with YAML frontmatter, `{{variable}}` interpolation, Rust parser in conflabd.
- **Template compose UX** — browse and compose templates from the macOS app with external editor delegation.
- **Programmable prompts** — Lua 5.4 runtime embedded in conflabd (sandboxed, capability-gated via mlua).
- **User-facing documentation** — template authoring guide and Lua scripting reference.
- **CI and distribution** — CI builds Conflab.app as a tar.gz artifact; Homebrew formula includes it as a resource.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **conflabd: message loop** — the daemon's own responses were routed back to the LLM agent in an infinite loop. The daemon authenticates as a human user, so outbound messages had `sender_type: "human"` and bypassed the `sender_type == "agent"` loop check. Fixed with self-echo detection (tracking sent message IDs) and sender-identifier filtering in the router.
- **conflabd: Anthropic prefill error** — provider calls failed with "conversation must end with a user message" when the trigger message wasn't yet in the `list_messages` result (race condition). Conversation history construction now always appends the trigger as the final user message, and consecutive same-role messages are merged.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **conflabd: date serialization bug** — `memory_search` returned corrupted dates (e.g. `-1914-06-26`) due to a sign error in the civil_from_days algorithm. Existing corrupted entries are automatically repaired on daemon startup.
- **conflabd: false unread counts** — on daemon restart or WebSocket reconnect, replayed catch-up messages were counted as new, causing spurious "N new message(s)" notifications. Replay messages are now correctly excluded from unread counters.
- **conflabd: verbose MCP transport logging** — `rmcp::transport` was dumping full JSON-RPC response bodies at INFO level, overwhelming the log file. Default log level is now `info,rmcp::transport=warn`.

### Added

- **`conflab daemon log-level` command** — get or set daemon log verbosity at runtime without restarting. Supports `tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter` directive syntax (e.g. `debug`, `info,rmcp=error`).
- **`conflab daemon logs` command** — view recent daemon log output from the terminal. Supports `-n` for line count and `-f` for live streaming.
- **`conflab daemon stop` command** — stop the running daemon and unload the launchd service.
- **`conflab daemon status` command** — check whether conflabd is running and show connection details.
- **`conflab daemon doctor` command** — validate daemon configuration and connectivity.

### Changed

- Consolidated duplicate date conversion code into a single `time_util` module (Highlander Rule).
- Updated daemon and CLI documentation for all new daemon subcommands.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Fixed fragile help sidebar test that asserted on decorative text.
- Removed stale `schema.graphql` dump that was no longer generated.

### Removed

- Cleaned up `.backup/` directory and added `.backup`, `.DS_Store`, `Icon?` to `.gitignore`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Homebrew distribution** — `brew tap geodica/conflab && brew install conflab`. Formula auto-updates on release.
- **Automated release workflow** (`scripts/release`) — version bump, tag, CI build, Homebrew formula update in one command.
- **Release shortcuts** — `scripts/release --patch`, `--minor`, `--major` for quick releases.
- Documentation: Homebrew installation instructions, conflabd overview section.
- Home page: Install section with Install and Documentation buttons.
- dist repo: docs index and updated README.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-26
